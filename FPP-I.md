## Final Project: Part - I (US Energy Consumption Trends)

### High-Level Summary
This project aims to showcase the evolution of US energy consumption across different sources over time. By visualizing data on fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable energy, the project will highlight trends, shifts, and potential future trajectories in energy use.

### Project Structure
1. **Introduction:** Contextualizing the US energy landscape.
2. **Historical Trends:** Visualizing changes in fossil fuel consumption (coal, natural gas, petroleum) over time.
3. **Rise of Renewables:** Charting the growth of renewable energy sources (hydroelectric, wind, solar, biomass).
4. **Nuclear Energy:** Assessing the role and trends in nuclear energy consumption.
5. **Comparative Analysis:** Contrasting the consumption patterns of different energy sources.
6. **Conclusion:** Summarizing insights and future outlook.

### Significance of the Topic
This project connects historical data with current energy debates, offering insights into how past consumption patterns might inform future energy policies. In one sentence: "Exploring the evolution of energy consumption reveals critical insights for shaping sustainable future energy strategies."

### Data Source
The data for this project is sourced from two primary locations:

1. **CO2 Measurements:** Collected by C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, these monthly mean CO2 values are available on the [Scripps CO2 Program website](http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2). Data adjustments account for missing days and are interpolated for missing months.

2. **Energy Consumption Data:** From the U.S. Energy Information Administration ([EIA](https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/dataunits.php)), this dataset includes detailed monthly records of various energy sources' consumption since January 1973.

### Initial Sketches
I plan to do the following types of graphs/ infographics in my project.

1. **Line Graphs** for each energy type showing consumption trends over time.

2. **Bar Charts** comparing annual consumption of different energy sources.

3. **Pie Charts** to illustrate the proportion of each energy type in total consumption for selected years.

4. **Infographics** highlighting key milestones in energy consumption history.

These sketches will help visualize how energy consumption patterns have evolved and where they might be heading.

### Final Project Plateform
For the project's final presentation, Shorthand, a digital storytelling platform, will be utilized. This platform is known for its user-friendly interface and visually engaging layouts, making it an excellent choice for presenting data-driven stories. The project will involve creating a narrative that seamlessly integrates the data visualizations, text explanations, and interactive elements. Shorthand's tools will enable the development of a compelling and immersive experience, guiding viewers through the evolution of energy consumption and its environmental impact. The project's completion will involve meticulous planning of the storyline, careful design of data visualizations, and strategic use of Shorthand's interactive features to ensure a coherent and impactful delivery of the project's key messages.
