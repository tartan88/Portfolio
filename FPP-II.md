## Final Project: Part - II (The Carbon Footprint: Tracing the Impact of US Energy Production on Climate Change)

### Introduction

2023 is set to be the warmest year on record. According to the World Meteorological Organization's provisional [State of the Global Climate](https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/2023-shatters-climate-records-major-impacts) report, data up to the end of October 2023 indicates that the year was approximately 1.40 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline from 1850-1900, with a margin of uncertainty of ±0.12°C. This is significant because it surpasses the record warmth observed in previous years, such as 2016 and 2020.

Furthermore, the first three quarters of 2023 experienced exceptional global heat, making it the [warmest year since records began in the mid-1800s](https://www.carbonbrief.org/state-of-the-climate-global-temperatures-throughout-mid-2023-shatter-records/) and likely for millennia. The last four months of this period, especially September, far exceeded any previous records, with September surpassing the prior record by about 0.5°C​.

Additionally, [NASA's Earth Observatory reported](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3282/nasa-announces-summer-2023-hottest-on-record/#:~:text=Credit%3A%20NASA%27s%20Earth%20Observatory%2FLauren%20Dauphin,any%20other%20summer%20in) that the summer of 2023 was Earth's hottest since global records began in 1880. June, July, and August combined temperatures were 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (0.23 degrees Celsius) warmer than any previous summer​.

### Wireframes
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.
