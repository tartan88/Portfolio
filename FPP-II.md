## Final Project: Part - II (The Carbon Footprint: Tracing the Impact of US Energy Production on Climate Change)

### Introduction

2023 is set to be the warmest year on record. According to the World Meteorological Organization's provisional [State of the Global Climate](https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/2023-shatters-climate-records-major-impacts) report, data up to the end of October 2023 indicates that the year was approximately 1.40 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline from 1850-1900, with a margin of uncertainty of ±0.12°C. This is significant because it surpasses the record warmth observed in previous years, such as 2016 and 2020.

Furthermore, the first three quarters of 2023 experienced exceptional global heat, making it the [warmest year since records began in the mid-1800s](https://www.carbonbrief.org/state-of-the-climate-global-temperatures-throughout-mid-2023-shatter-records/) and likely for millennia. The last four months of this period, especially September, far exceeded any previous records, with September surpassing the prior record by about 0.5°C.

Additionally, [NASA's Earth Observatory reported](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3282/nasa-announces-summer-2023-hottest-on-record/#:~:text=Credit%3A%20NASA%27s%20Earth%20Observatory%2FLauren%20Dauphin,any%20other%20summer%20in) that the summer of 2023 was Earth's hottest since global records began in 1880. The combined temperatures of June, July, and August were 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (0.23 degrees Celsius) warmer than any previous summer.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a pivotal indicator of climate change, primarily due to their substantial contribution to the greenhouse effect. In 2023, [global CO2 emissions from energy use and industry are projected to potentially peak](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-global-co2-emissions-could-peak-as-soon-as-2023-iea-data-reveals/#:~:text=International%20policy%20Analysis%3A%20Global%20CO2,IEA), signaling a crucial moment in the context of climate change. The significance of CO2 as an indicator is underlined by the fact that each year, human activities emit more CO2 than natural processes can remove, leading to a consistent increase in atmospheric CO2 levels. [This escalation was evident with a new record high in 2022, at 417.06 parts per million](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide#:~:text=Published%20May%2012%2C%202023%20Highlights,06%20parts%20per%20million). By October 2023, [this concentration had further risen to 419 ppm](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8HpRVv9oVuSCF0VZQsQUZzqFhGtkLyw06Pme5RT0S-5vbMKKeT7887JYALC3WjAsIKVkac#:~:text=LATEST%20MEASUREMENT%3A%20October%202023%20419,in%20less%20than%20200%20years), a stark reminder of the ongoing impact of human activities, which have increased atmospheric CO2 by 50% in less than two centuries. [The primary role of CO2 emissions in driving global climate change is well-recognized](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions#:~:text=Carbon%20dioxide%20emissions%20are%20the,of%20contention%20in%20international%20discussions), underscoring the urgent need for worldwide efforts to reduce emissions to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.

![CO2 Historical Trend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tartan88/Portfolio/main/co2rise.png)

The [historical context of CO2 emissions](https://www.wri.org/insights/history-carbon-dioxide-emissions#:~:text=At%20the%20beginning%20of%20our,%E3%80%9074%E2%80%A02%E3%80%91) reveals a dramatic and escalating trend. In the mid-19th century, the United Kingdom was the primary emitter, with its emissions being six times higher than those of the United States, which ranked second. By 1850, global CO2 emissions were considerably lower, but with the advent of industrialization, especially in the United States, emissions saw a steady rise. Between 1850 and 1960, emissions grew consistently due to industrialization and population growth. Post-1960, the landscape of CO2 emitters shifted, with China emerging as a major contributor, eventually surpassing the United States as the top emitter after 2005. By 2007, CO2 emissions from developing nations exceeded those of industrialized countries, highlighting a significant shift in the global emissions profile. In 2011, the top 10 emitting countries contributed 78% of global CO2 emissions, a reflection of the concentrated nature of emissions sources​​​.

> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.
