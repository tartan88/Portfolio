#### Why I chose this?

This infographic was selected for analysis because it encapsulates critical socioeconomic data. It illustrates the percentage of workers earning minimum wage or less across the United States, a topic that lies at the intersection of policy, economy, and social welfare, and thus is of considerable interest to a broad audience, including policymakers, economists, and the general public. The visualization employs a geographic map, an approach that leverages spatial recognition to convey complex data in an intuitive format. However, the choice of a monochromatic color scheme and the lack of comparative context present an opportunity for critique and redesign. By analyzing this visualization, I aim to enhance its communicative power, ensuring that it informs, invites analysis, and elicits a deeper understanding of the data it represents. The nuances of its design—such as color contrast and data presentation—provide a fertile ground for discussion on how to transform a basic infographic into an advanced form that is both informative and insightful, fulfilling the potential of data visualization as a tool for storytelling and engagement in the digital age.

### Wireframe a solution

#### My idea for improvement:

While redesigning, my rationale was to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced view of the minimum wage data over time. I wanted to move beyond a single snapshot in time, which the original map provided, to a more dynamic, longitudinal perspective. By presenting the data in a year-by-year table format, I aimed to make it easier for viewers to spot trends, compare changes across years, and analyze the impact of policy or economic shifts on minimum wage earners.

The color gradient was a deliberate choice to create a visual narrative of the data's progression. It allows for quick visual cues to identify which states have seen significant increases or decreases in the percentage of minimum-wage workers. This kind of design is rooted in the belief that complex data requires clear and accessible presentation to inform and empower policymakers, economists, and the general public.

Moreover, I ensured that every state was equally visible, regardless of geographic size, which is a limitation of many map-based infographics. By treating each state's data with equal weight, the infographic democratizes the information and avoids the common pitfall of underrepresenting less populous regions. In essence, my design was about clarity, depth, and fairness in data representation, making the statistics as meaningful and accessible as possible.

### Testing the solution

Following is the gist of my interviews:  

**Student (mid-30s)**  
Me: Take a look at this visualization. Without any context from me, can you tell me what you think this is about?  
Student: It seems to be some sort of data table showing percentages. It's about the number of people earning the minimum wage or less in different states over several years.  
Me: What do you feel this table is telling you?  
Student: It's showing how the percentages change over time, possibly indicating economic trends or the effectiveness of wage policies.  
Me: Is there anything that you find particularly surprising or confusing?  
Student: The color coding is a bit confusing. I'm not sure if darker colors mean higher or lower percentages, and the significance of the change in color isn't clear. (He did not look at the legend)  
Me: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?  
Student: I would say it's for economists or policymakers, but it's also quite accessible, so it could be for the general public.  
Me: Anything you would change or do differently?  
Student: Include some sort of guide or legend for the colors, and maybe some charts to make the trends more visually digestible. (Here I told him to see the legend)  

**Professor (mid-40s)**  
Me: Looking at this visualization, can you describe what it represents?  
Professor: This table appears to track the percentage of people in each state earning at or below the federal minimum wage across several years.  
Me: What insights or conclusions can you draw from this data?  
Professor: The data could be used to analyze the effectiveness of state-level minimum wage increases compared to the federal rate.  
Me: Is there anything in the visualization that you find surprising or could be improved?  
Professor: The data is presented good, but there's no clear narrative or conclusion being drawn. It's purely informational without analysis.  
Me: Considering your background, who do you think this is meant for?  
Professor: It's likely aimed at those in academia or policy analysis, though it's missing critical analysis that would make it more useful for scholarly work.  
Me: What modifications would you suggest for this visualization?  
Professor: I would recommend sorting the data in a way that it shows which states are doing worse in terms of minimum wage or less earners.
