#### Why I chose this?

This infographic was selected for analysis because it encapsulates critical socioeconomic data. It illustrates the percentage of workers earning minimum wage or less across the United States, a topic that lies at the intersection of policy, economy, and social welfare, and thus is of considerable interest to a broad audience, including policymakers, economists, and the general public. The visualization employs a geographic map, an approach that leverages spatial recognition to convey complex data in an intuitive format. However, the choice of a monochromatic color scheme and the lack of comparative context present an opportunity for critique and redesign. By analyzing this visualization, I aim to enhance its communicative power, ensuring that it informs, invites analysis, and elicits a deeper understanding of the data it represents. The nuances of its design—such as color contrast and data presentation—provide a fertile ground for discussion on how to transform a basic infographic into an advanced form that is both informative and insightful, fulfilling the potential of data visualization as a tool for storytelling and engagement in the digital age.

#### Explanation of the data:

The data from the Excel file "Minimum Wage or Less by State" consists of four columns:

1. **State**: This column lists various U.S. states.
2. **Total**: Represents the total percentage of workers in the state earning at or below the minimum wage.
3. **At Minimum Wage**: Indicates the percentage of workers in the state who earn exactly the minimum wage.
4. **Below Minimum Wage**: Shows the percentage of workers in the state who earn below the minimum wage.

For example, in Alabama in 2021, 1.8% of workers earn at or below the minimum wage, with 0.5% at the minimum wage and 1.3% below it.

The data has 6 sheets, each for one year fom 2016 - 2021.

### Wireframe a solution

#### My idea for improvement:

While redesigning, my rationale was to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced view of the minimum wage data over time. I wanted to move beyond a single snapshot in time, which the original map provided, to a more dynamic, longitudinal perspective. By presenting the data in a year-by-year table format, I aimed to make it easier for viewers to spot trends, compare changes across years, and analyze the impact of policy or economic shifts on minimum wage earners.

The color gradient was a deliberate choice to create a visual narrative of the data's progression. It allows for quick visual cues to identify which states have seen significant increases or decreases in the percentage of minimum-wage workers. This kind of design is rooted in the belief that complex data requires clear and accessible presentation to inform and empower policymakers, economists, and the general public.

Moreover, I ensured that every state was equally visible, regardless of geographic size, which is a limitation of many map-based infographics. By treating each state's data with equal weight, the infographic democratizes the information and avoids the common pitfall of underrepresenting less populous regions. In essence, my design was about clarity, depth, and fairness in data representation, making the statistics as meaningful and accessible as possible.

### Testing the solution

Following is the gist of my interviews:  

**Student (mid-30s)**  
Me: Take a look at this visualization. Without any context from me, can you tell me what you think this is about?  
Student: It seems to be some sort of data table showing percentages. It's about the number of people earning the minimum wage or less in different states over several years.  
Me: What do you feel this table is telling you?  
Student: It's showing how the percentages change over time, possibly indicating economic trends or the effectiveness of wage policies.  
Me: Is there anything that you find particularly surprising or confusing?  
Student: The color coding is a bit confusing. I'm not sure if darker colors mean higher or lower percentages, and the significance of the change in color isn't clear. (He did not look at the legend)  
Me: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?  
Student: I would say it's for economists or policymakers, but it's also quite accessible, so it could be for the general public.  
Me: Anything you would change or do differently?  
Student: Include some sort of guide or legend for the colors, and maybe some charts to make the trends more visually digestible. (Here I told him to see the legend)  

**Professor (mid-40s)**  
Me: Looking at this visualization, can you describe what it represents?  
Professor: This table appears to track the percentage of people in each state earning at or below the federal minimum wage across several years.  
Me: What insights or conclusions can you draw from this data?  
Professor: The data could be used to analyze the effectiveness of state-level minimum wage increases compared to the federal rate.  
Me: Is there anything in the visualization that you find surprising or could be improved?  
Professor: The data is presented good, but there's no clear narrative or conclusion being drawn. It's purely informational without analysis.  
Me: Considering your background, who do you think this is meant for?  
Professor: It's likely aimed at those in academia or policy analysis, though it's missing critical analysis that would make it more useful for scholarly work.  
Me: What modifications would you suggest for this visualization?  
Professor: I would recommend sorting the data in a way that it shows which states are doing worse in terms of minimum wage or less earners.

#### **How the final Infographic is better than the original one?**

The final infographic, a heat map of the percentage of people earning the federal minimum wage or less from 2016 to 2021, has been crafted to address the shortcomings of the original infographic through several key enhancements:

1. **Enhanced Color Contrast and Clarity**: 
The original map utilized a monochromatic blue palette, which was not only challenging for color differentiation but also did not cater to those with color vision deficiencies. The final infographic employs a color gradient that spans from light orange to dark red, offering a more significant contrast between the values and facilitating an easier distinction of data points. This color scheme adheres to best practices for data visualization, ensuring the information is accessible to a wider audience, including those with color blindness.

2. **Temporal Comparison**: 
Where the original map provided a static snapshot of a single year, the heat map extended the analysis across six years. This temporal element is critical in understanding trends and patterns in the minimum wage landscape over time, offering insights into each state's economic progression or regression.

3. **Interactive Elements**: 
Interactivity is a significant addition to the final infographic. The original map's static nature is transformed into an interactive experience, allowing users to engage with the data on a deeper level. Viewers can hover over specific states to see detailed information for each year, making the data more tangible and the trends more apparent.

4. **Data Density and Information Layering**: 
In addressing the data density and layering, the final infographic offers a comprehensive view without overwhelming the viewer. Each state's data is presented in such a way that high-level information is easily digestible, while more detailed data is available upon interaction, catering to both casual observers and more detail-oriented users.

5. **Narrative and Analytical Depth**: 
Moving beyond mere presentation, the final infographic is structured to tell a story. It's not just about where the minimum wage earners are, but also about the socioeconomic narratives that the trends might suggest. The heat map invites viewers to ask questions about the data—such as the implications of these percentages on local economies and living standards—and provides a platform for further investigation.

6. **Design and Layout Improvements**: 
The layout has been improved for better readability and user experience. The font sizes, cell spacing, and overall arrangement have been optimized to make the visualization informative and aesthetically pleasing.

#### What input from the interviews has been incorporated?

After receiving feedback on the initial draft of the infographic, I recognized the importance of presenting the data in a manner that readily highlights the states with the highest percentages of minimum wage earners, which would underscore the regions where wage disparities might be most pronounced. Therefore, I adjusted the sorting order so that the states are listed from those with the highest percentage of individuals earning the federal minimum wage or less at the top, descending to those with the lowest at the bottom. This change in sorting order shifts the focus immediately to the areas of greatest concern and invites a more critical analysis of the factors contributing to these rates. This adjustment not only enhances the infographic's clarity but also its utility as an analytical tool, allowing policymakers, researchers, and the public to quickly identify and prioritize states that may require more urgent attention and intervention. The result is a final product that is not just visually informative but also strategically structured to prompt discussion and action on the issue of minimum wage earnings in the United States.

#### Why did I not use any design from Viz Review and Watch me Viz videos?

I chose not to use designs from the Viz Review and Watch me Viz videos because, while they offer rich insights into data visualization, the infographics featured tend to be quite complex and densely packed with information. These designs, though informative for a data-savvy audience, can be overwhelming and less accessible to the general public. My aim was to create an infographic that would be immediately understandable to anyone, regardless of their familiarity with data interpretation. By simplifying the design and focusing on the most crucial data points, I ensured that the final product was viewer-friendly, clear, and engaging for a wider audience. This approach makes the information more digestible and allows viewers to grasp the key messages at a glance without the need for in-depth analysis, which aligns with the goal of reaching as broad an audience as possible.
