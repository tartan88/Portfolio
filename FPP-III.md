# The Carbon Footprint: Tracing the Impact of US Energy Production on Climate Change

## Introduction:
As we navigate the pivotal decade of 2020, our planet stands at a crossroads of climate challenges and energy transformation. “The Carbon Footprint: Tracing the Impact of US Energy Production on Climate Change” is an explorative journey through the intricate relationship between America’s energy choices and the carbon footprint they leave behind.
The year 2023 is poised to be inscribed in history as the warmest year on record, edging past the critical 1.40°C global temperature increase above pre-industrial levels—a threshold that brings us perilously close to the 1.5°C limit set by the Paris Agreement to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change (World Meteorological Organization, 2023). The exceptional global heat experienced in the first three quarters of the year underscores the accelerating pace of climate change, with NASA’s Earth Observatory highlighting the summer of 2023 as the planet’s hottest since records began in 1880.
Amidst this warming, the United States, a historical leader in industrialization, stands as a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions. The project dissects half a century’s data, revealing a trend where CO2 emissions have escalated to 419 parts per million by October 2023, up from 417.06 ppm in the previous year, signifying an alarming increase of about 50% in atmospheric CO2 in less than two centuries (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 2023).

My story delves into the historical trends of energy consumption, tracing back to the mid-19th century when the UK led in emissions, to the current landscape where developing nations and industrialized countries jostle for the top emitter status. The narrative unfolds to reveal the shift in the US energy mix from 1973 to 2023, reflecting a promising increase in renewable energy yet juxtaposed against the stark reality of rising CO2 emissions. This paradox of progress lays bare the complexity of the energy-environment nexus.
The carbon cost of producing electricity is scrutinized through the prism of carbon intensity, comparing the CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour of energy produced from coal, petroleum, natural gas, biomass, and renewable sources. This analysis serves as a cornerstone of my exploration, considering the International Energy Agency’s projection that global CO2 emissions from energy use and industry could potentially peak this year, marking a defining moment in the trajectory of global warming (International Energy Agency, 2023).
As we chart the future, this project will not only spotlight the United States’ current energy consumption choices but also propose a path forward. The US’s influence on the global stage as a major CO2 emitter means that any significant shifts in its energy policy could sway the international climate change battle. The project is a call to action, urging a transition towards cleaner energy, not just for environmental imperatives but as a strategic maneuver in the geopolitical arena, where energy independence and technological leadership are increasingly synonymous with global influence.
In this narrative, we are not mere spectators; we are participants with the power to influence outcomes. Through rigorous research, interviews with academia and industry experts, and comprehensive data visualization, “The Carbon Footprint” seeks to empower, educate, and engage a diverse audience in the vital conversation on climate change and sustainable energy practices. My journey through this data story is a testament to the power of informed choices and the indelible impact they have on our planet’s future.
