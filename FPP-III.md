# The Carbon Footprint: Tracing the Impact of US Energy Production on Climate Change

## Introduction
As we navigate the pivotal decade of 2020, our planet stands at a crossroads of climate challenges and energy transformation. “The Carbon Footprint: Tracing the Impact of US Energy Production on Climate Change” is an explorative journey through the intricate relationship between America’s energy choices and the carbon footprint they leave behind.
The year 2023 is poised to be inscribed in history as the warmest year on record, edging past the critical 1.40°C global temperature increase above pre-industrial levels—a threshold that brings us perilously close to the 1.5°C limit set by the Paris Agreement to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change (World Meteorological Organization, 2023). The exceptional global heat experienced in the first three quarters of the year underscores the accelerating pace of climate change, with NASA’s Earth Observatory highlighting the summer of 2023 as the planet’s hottest since records began in 1880.
Amidst this warming, the United States, a historical leader in industrialization, stands as a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions. The project dissects half a century’s data, revealing a trend where CO2 emissions have escalated to 419 parts per million by October 2023, up from 417.06 ppm in the previous year, signifying an alarming increase of about 50% in atmospheric CO2 in less than two centuries (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 2023).

My story delves into the historical trends of energy consumption, tracing back to the mid-19th century when the UK led in emissions, to the current landscape where developing nations and industrialized countries jostle for the top emitter status. The narrative unfolds to reveal the shift in the US energy mix from 1973 to 2023, reflecting a promising increase in renewable energy yet juxtaposed against the stark reality of rising CO2 emissions. This paradox of progress lays bare the complexity of the energy-environment nexus.
The carbon cost of producing electricity is scrutinized through the prism of carbon intensity, comparing the CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour of energy produced from coal, petroleum, natural gas, biomass, and renewable sources. This analysis serves as a cornerstone of my exploration, considering the International Energy Agency’s projection that global CO2 emissions from energy use and industry could potentially peak this year, marking a defining moment in the trajectory of global warming (International Energy Agency, 2023).
As we chart the future, this project will not only spotlight the United States’ current energy consumption choices but also propose a path forward. The US’s influence on the global stage as a major CO2 emitter means that any significant shifts in its energy policy could sway the international climate change battle. The project is a call to action, urging a transition towards cleaner energy, not just for environmental imperatives but as a strategic maneuver in the geopolitical arena, where energy independence and technological leadership are increasingly synonymous with global influence.
In this narrative, we are not mere spectators; we are participants with the power to influence outcomes. Through rigorous research, interviews with academia and industry experts, and comprehensive data visualization, “The Carbon Footprint” seeks to empower, educate, and engage a diverse audience in the vital conversation on climate change and sustainable energy practices. My journey through this data story is a testament to the power of informed choices and the indelible impact they have on our planet’s future.

## Change in US Energy Consumption Mix 1973-2023
In the grand tapestry of the United States’ energy narrative, the years between 1973 and 2023 stand out as a period of profound transformation. Over these five decades, the energy consumption mix of the nation has undergone a metamorphosis that reflects not only technological innovation and economic shifts but also a burgeoning consciousness of environmental stewardship and sustainability.
In the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, the United States, like much of the industrialized world, was jolted into the reality of its energy vulnerabilities. The nation’s energy portfolio, then heavily skewed towards oil and coal, began a slow yet decisive pivot. The pie charts representing this era show a domination of fossil fuels, with renewables barely a sliver of the overall energy consumption mix.
Fast forward to 2023, and the landscape has been reshaped. The emergence of renewable energy sources—solar, wind, hydroelectric, and biomass—has redefined the energy consumption mix. This shift is captured vividly in my project’s comparative visualizations, which juxtapose the solid, almost monolithic presence of fossil fuels in 1973 with the burgeoning diversity of energy sources in 2023.

Yet, this change did not occur in a vacuum. It has been propelled by a confluence of factors: the advancement in renewable technologies, decreasing costs of production, policy incentives, and a palpable shift in public sentiment towards green energy. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has chronicled this transition, providing granular data that reveals an economy in the midst of an energy renaissance (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023).
However, the story is not one of unqualified success. Despite the notable increase in renewable energy’s share, it is juxtaposed against the backdrop of an ever-increasing appetite for energy. The total energy demand has surged, and fossil fuel consumption, though a smaller percentage of the mix, remains substantial in absolute terms. The consequence is a continued rise in CO2 emissions, a sobering reminder that the path to a truly sustainable energy future is fraught with complexity and inertia.

The project’s visualizations aim to render this complex data into a comprehensible narrative. We not only see the change in percentages but can also explore the underlying numbers. Our story seeks to elucidate the dichotomy of progress: a nation that has made strides towards a greener energy mix but still grapples with the legacy of its carbon-heavy past.
As we stand in 2023, the cross-section of energy consumption in the US is a mosaic that tells of progress, challenges, and the potential for a reimagined energy paradigm. It is a stark illustration of the nation’s journey from a fossil-fuel-dependent past to a future that, while still uncertain, has the potential to be powered by the winds, waters, and sun.
