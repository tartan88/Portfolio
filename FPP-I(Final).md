### Energy Consumption Trends Project

#### High-Level Summary
This project aims to showcase the evolution of energy consumption across different sources over time. By visualizing data on fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable energy, the project will highlight trends, shifts, and potential future trajectories in energy use.

#### Project Structure
1. **Introduction:** Contextualizing the global energy landscape.
2. **Historical Trends:** Visualizing changes in fossil fuel consumption (coal, natural gas, petroleum) over time.
3. **Rise of Renewables:** Charting the growth of renewable energy sources (hydroelectric, wind, solar, biomass).
4. **Nuclear Energy:** Assessing the role and trends in nuclear energy consumption.
5. **Comparative Analysis:** Contrasting the consumption patterns of different energy sources.
6. **Conclusion:** Summarizing insights and future outlook.

#### Significance of the Topic
This project connects historical data with current energy debates, offering insights into how past consumption patterns might inform future energy policies. In one sentence: "Exploring the evolution of energy consumption reveals critical insights for shaping sustainable future energy strategies."

#### Data Source
The data is from a public source, detailing monthly energy consumption across various sources like coal, natural gas, petroleum, nuclear, and different renewables from January 1973 onwards.

#### Initial Sketches
1. **Line Graphs** for each energy type showing consumption trends over time.
2. **Bar Charts** comparing annual consumption of different energy sources.
3. **Pie Charts** to illustrate the proportion of each energy type in total consumption for selected years.
4. **Infographics** highlighting key milestones in energy consumption history.

These sketches will help visualize how energy consumption patterns have evolved and where they might be heading.
